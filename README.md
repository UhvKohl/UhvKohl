- 👋 Hi, I’m Udhav (@UhvKohl). 
- 👀 I am aspiring physicist. Though I graduated from high school in May 2021, I am going to begin university this year in September.
- 🌱 I’m currently using "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" to learn the basics of Python. 
- 💞️ Other than that, I have began using WowChemy to blog other passions of my life such as powerlifting and playing the guitar.
- 📫 If you'd like to coverse with me, you can reach out to me through my email (udhav.kohli@outlook.com)!
